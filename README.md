# netlify-react-public
It simply contains the commit history of the private `netlify-react`<br> 
***This is a side project.*** <br>
***It is not production ready code***<br>

## Why?
To show the progress of private side project. <br> It help showcase what I am doing in my private time but without having to reveal the source code. <br>
I do not wish at the present moment to reveal the source code for personal reasons.

**üôèGithubüôè**: Please add the ability to show `private repo` but not actual source code so that viewers can still see the progress of a developer regradless of whether they are working on `private` or `public repo`. Obviously letting developers choose because they equally may not want to.

 4. etc . . .

## 20-02-2020
1. Changes made to `standardizeText` function of `Utils` to add a space character at the end of each line so that `CMS` `array` of `text` does not have to conatain an extra ` ` space at the end of each line in an `array`.
2. `SimpleCard`'s `text` now `aligned` to left as oppose to center.
3. Added icon support for `SimpleCard` using `mainIcon`.
4. `CMS` changed for various screens to benefit from icon support available in `SimpleCard`. Following screeens have benefited from ^ above ^ feature: 
<br>`MyStoryCMS`, <br>`ChangeTheme`, <br>`MoreCMS`, <br>`ProjectsCMS`
5. `getCardActions` of `Utils` now supports `open in new tab` feature where any external link is opened in a new tab.
6. Subtle changes to `ProjectsCMS`
7. Updated `Routes` inline with the new content added to `ProjectCMS`
8. Added `CorporateExperiences` screen, bare skeleton
9. Added releveant `CorporateExperiencesCMS` for use later on today
10. Refined or rather added some comments to main `App.js` and renamed some variable names for cleaner code.
11. Added `ComplexCardList` component to be used in `CorporateExperiences` screen or rather useful in that respect.
12. `ComplexCard`'s `action` buttons now wrap around in a fluid way and pleasant to eyes. This is useful when there are more than 2 buttons when it would previously try to compact everything and hold it in one row.

## 19-02-2020
1. `SimpleCard`'s `text` typography component changed from `p` to `div` which allows `text` to be more roubust component as `p` is more limiting.
2. Backspace speed animation in `TypeWriter` increased to 3 from -1 being the default speed.
3. `CMS` added for `MyStory` screen to show "real" and "actual" story with full typing animation and effects. 
4. `ReRender` component added
5. Basically it is a safer way to `rerender` without having to use `forceRender` functionality
6. Added `ReRender` as `reRender` in `Utils` library
7. Added internal `random key` to `TypeWriter` as required by React
8. Disabling rereading story feature as `react-typing-animation` needs to support `reset` functionality internally.
9. Developing custom solution is not a high priority myself nor something of recommendation.
10. Fixed a bug in `getBottomAppBarPath` in `Routes.js` where if a `route` is in "home" than return home icon
11. Added `key={ Math.random() }` to a `list` as React complains too much when an `element` in a list does not have unique `key`.
12. The merit of using `key={ Math.random() }` is debatable because it makes impossible to identify the react `element` using unique key for any purposes.
13. Added `key={ Math.random() }` to `More.js` screen as I forgot to add.
14. Changed `Projects` screen to `Work Experience` screen
15. Added `SimpleCardList` which is built on top of `SimpleCard` for listing an array of cards from `CMS`
16. `More` screen now using `SimpleCardList` and debloating some of the code as a result of it.
17. Added `standardizeText` function to `Utils` which simply parses the HTML if `text` contains marked up `HTML` and also `text` can be simple string or `array` of text
18. This functionality was being duplicated at more than 3 different components hence the call to `standardize` it all in one place
19. `SimpleCard`, `ComplexCard`, `CustomTypography` all now rely on `standardizeText` of `Utils` so that central functionality can be changed easily from one central place.
20. `SimpleCard` now requires new property `noStandardizeText` which will not `standardize` it's `text` property. Main use case for this is if `text` is a `CustomTypography` component or other custom component in which case the `standardizing` will take place inside the component.
21. `MyStory` benefiting from `noStandardizeText` property as previous update would have broken it.
22. `Work Experience` screen updated with cards
23. Added neccessary `CMS` to it.

## 18-02-2020
1. `safeColor` functionality removed from `Colors` due to `circular reference` 
2. `safeColor` functionality added to `Themes` - it makes sense for it to be there
3. App's font sizes are now responsive
4. `PageTitle` component added to main App which can effectively show each screen's page title based on the screen automatically without having to place  `PageTitle` on each screen.
5. `Routes` screen name change to Welcome as oppose to boring "Home"
6. Change to Home `CMS` - slight variation of words
7. `ComplexCard`'s `actions` property now automatically enables navigating using `CMS`
8. Initial `MyStory` screen added
9. Initial navigation working
10. Home `CMS` updated to all work
11. Much improvements to `TypeWriter` component
12. `CMS` `line` data can now be an `array` of simple text
13. Backspacing had a bug  - it would calculate the number of backspaces based on HTML text which meant `<span>Hi</span>` would result into `15` backspaces as oppose to `2` 

## 17-02-2020
1. `TypeWriter` component added for typing animation effect
2. Full `HTML` formatting supported
3. Customizable in terms of delaying between each line
4. `SimpleCard` allows customised `width` for ease or for bespoke situations
5. `makeStyles` moved inside `function` to allow dynamic value setting
6. Changed `routes`'s `route` property to `path`
7. Changed structure to allow more central control from `routes` component
8. Getting rid of `bull` ‚Ä¢ `variable` of `SimpleCard`
9. Renaming of `routes`'s function `routing` to `getBottomAppBarPath` to avoid any confusion or as to what the function does
10. Added `getPageTitle` to `routes` for getting screen's title based on the URL route

## 16-02-2020
1. Fixed a bug in `ComplexCard` and `CustomTypography` where if text is
   not in array it would not be `parsed` for HTML.
2. CSS classes `highlight` improved
3. `border` new `class` added.
4. `underline` now uses `border-bottom` for superior style than `font-style: underline`

1. `ComplexCard` now support `HTML` formatting for easy styling of content
2. `ComplexCard` now supports line breaks based on fullstop `.` for easier reading style 
3. `CMS` text can be set as simple text or in an array. `ComplexCard` deals with it appropriatley
4. `CustomTypography` also supports `HTML` formatting just as `ComplexCard` 
5. Line breaks are also supported for `CustomTypography` and `CMS` content for easy as array or text either way
6. 5 new `classes` added for formatting of text and ease of convinience!<br>
       `highlight`<br>
       `quote`<br>
       `bold`<br>
       `italics`<br>
       `underline`<br>
7. 

## 14-02-2020

1. Added `Beth Ellen` and `Reem Kufi` fonts and removed `Mr Dafoe`
2. Added `Bismillah` component<br>
   Basic philosophy of putting God first!
3. `Petit Formal Script` font removed
4. `Beth Ellan` font removed
5. 2 new fonts added: `Amatic SC`, `Bungee Shade` - both these are `display` fonts for drawing special attention
6. `ComplexCard` component now support custom `typography` for main text content
7. `Bismillah` now no longer `bold`
8. `Utils`'s `getCardActions` now expects an array rather than entire `card`<br>
   This means `getCardActions` can be envoked from `SimpleCard` internally for simplification purposes
9. `BottomAppBar`'s gradient transparency is increased to 70% from 60%
10. `SimpleCard` expects now an array of plain `actions` as oppose to returning a JSON object of actions, this is now done from inside       `SimpleCard`. This way the main control can be changed from within `SimpleCard` in near future
11. `CMS` inside `More` component has been renamed to `MoreCMS` for easiser searching from within `vscode`
    Simplification of syntax to `SimpleCard` according to recent changes made to `SimpleCard`
12. Added `expandButton` property to  `ComplexCard` component so that it can be easily used to expand card but using some button text -       This effectively means expand button is duplicated but one with a text as not everyone may be used to expanding it or may not know       what expansion content contains. In that situation having a button text is very useful.
13. `ComplexCard`'s `imageURL` now expects only the file name, no longer a `path` as this is centrally done from within `ComplexCard` for     simplification and centralised purposes.
14. Added `margin` 10 to `ComplexCard` so that when used in list - they have some border and distance  between each other
    Same behaviour as `SimpleCard`
15. Changed `text-align` to left side for expansion text for `ComplexCard` component 
16. Added `CMS` for Home screen
17. Added initial profile card for main home screen

6. Some refinments added
7. `CSS` added for custom styling and easy to change in regards to Chrome `Developer Tools`
8. Enhanced `Card`'s `CSS` so it does not get stretched up depending on the one of the children taking more.
   <br>It is still not fully Google Images like but a little better. Far from it.
9. Made card more `rounded` for an elegant look and feel
10. `ComplexCard`'s image is now `rounded` too which is debatable whether it looks pleasant or just to me
11. Added `margin-right` to `card`'s action buttons so that it does not look squished when there is more than 1 button. 
12. Added custom `Typography` components
13. Added `CustomTypography` component for easy change of fonts for certain type of components

4. `Bottom App Bar` is more like translucent in line with the overall theme
5. Added `Utils` for simplified development
