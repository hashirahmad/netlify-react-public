# netlify-react-public
It simply contains the commit history of the private `netlify-react`<br> 
***This is a side project.*** <br>
***It is not production ready code***<br>

## Why?
To show the progress of private side project. <br> It help showcase what I am doing in my private time but without having to reveal the source code. <br>
I do not wish at the present moment to reveal the source code for personal reasons.

**üôèGithubüôè**: Please add the ability to show `private repo` but not actual source code so that viewers can still see the progress of a developer regradless of whether they are working on `private` or `public repo`. Obviously letting developers choose because they equally may not want to.

## 14-02-2020

1. Added `Beth Ellen` and `Reem Kufi` fonts and removed `Mr Dafoe`
2. Added `Bismillah` component<br>
   Basic philosophy of putting God first!
3. `Petit Formal Script` font removed
4. `Beth Ellan` font removed
5. 2 new fonts added: `Amatic SC`, `Bungee Shade` - both these are `display` fonts for drawing special attention
6. `ComplexCard` component now support custom `typography` for main text content
7. `Bismillah` now no longer `bold`
8. `Utils`'s `getCardActions` now expects an array rather than entire `card`<br>
   This means `getCardActions` can be envoked from `SimpleCard` internally for simplification purposes
9. `BottomAppBar`'s gradient transparency is increased to 70% from 60%
10. `SimpleCard` expects now an array of plain `actions` as oppose to returning a JSON object of actions, this is now done from inside       `SimpleCard`. This way the main control can be changed from within `SimpleCard` in near future
11. `CMS` inside `More` component has been renamed to `MoreCMS` for easiser searching from within `vscode`
    Simplification of syntax to `SimpleCard` according to recent changes made to `SimpleCard`
12. Added `expandButton` property to  `ComplexCard` component so that it can be easily used to expand card but using some button text -       This effectively means expand button is duplicated but one with a text as not everyone may be used to expanding it or may not know       what expansion content contains. In that situation having a button text is very useful.
13. `ComplexCard`'s `imageURL` now expects only the file name, no longer a `path` as this is centrally done from within `ComplexCard` for     simplification and centralised purposes.
14. Added `margin` 10 to `ComplexCard` so that when used in list - they have some border and distance  between each other
    Same behaviour as `SimpleCard`
15. Changed `text-align` to left side for expansion text for `ComplexCard` component 
16. Added `CMS` for Home screen
17. Added initial profile card for main home screen


## 13-02-2020

2. Added "outline" `variance` to `card` button
3. Benefiting from `icon` support and setting icons dynmaically
4. Added a material design `ComplexCard` component with fully dynamic anatomy
5. `ComplexCard`'s `avatarInitials` removed - it is now automatically generted from `title`
6. Some refinments added
7. `CSS` added for custom styling and easy to change in regards to Chrome `Developer Tools`
8. Enhanced `Card`'s `CSS` so it does not get stretched up depending on the one of the children taking more.
   <br>It is still not fully Google Images like but a little better. Far from it.
9. Made card more `rounded` for an elegant look and feel
10. `ComplexCard`'s image is now `rounded` too which is debatable whether it looks pleasant or just to me
11. Added `margin-right` to `card`'s action buttons so that it does not look squished when there is more than 1 button. 
12. Added custom `Typography` components
13. Added `CustomTypography` component for easy change of fonts for certain type of components
14. Changed `Signature` component with different `Charmonman` font
