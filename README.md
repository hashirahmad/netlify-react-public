# netlify-react-public
It simply contains the commit history of the private `netlify-react`<br> 
***This is a side project.*** <br>
***It is not production ready code***<br>

## Why?
To show the progress of private side project. <br> It help showcase what I am doing in my private time but without having to reveal the source code. <br>
I do not wish at the present moment to reveal the source code for personal reasons.

**üôèGithubüôè**: Please add the ability to show `private repo` but not actual source code so that viewers can still see the progress of a developer regradless of whether they are working on `private` or `public repo`. Obviously letting developers choose because they equally may not want to.
